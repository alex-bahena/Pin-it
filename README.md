# Backend-code
This section describes the main FE features and how they work...

## Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that runs on the server.
Node.js advantage is that allows frontend developers that write JavaScript to run the server-side code and frontend-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

## server.js 
const http = require('http')
const hostname = '127.0.0.1'const port = 3000
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {  res.statusCode = 200  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')  res.end('Hello World\n')})
server.listen(port, hostname, () => {  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`)})

## Package.json file
A package.json file can be described as a manifest of your project that includes the packages and applications it depends on, information about its unique source control, and specific metadata like the project's name, description, and author.

## Node.js frameworks - Express
Es the most widely used Node.js server framework, and allows you to quickly and easily establish your API routes and associated HTTP request methods.

## Routing
Server design to handle responses when a client makes a request at a specific endpoint, or URL. In an earlier unit, you learned how to make GET requests from the client-side. Now, you will learn how those requests are handled on the server-side. Your server will listen for a specific type of request at a specific endpoint and when it hears that request, it will respond accordingly. 

## MySQL
A database is a collection of data stored electronically. The database management system (DBMS) we will be using in this unit is MySQL. MySQL is the most popular SQL database. The SQL in MySQL is short for Structured Query Language, and that structure is relational. A relational database stores and finds data based on its relationship to other data in the database. Relational databases are tabular, meaning data is stored in tables composed of rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet.

## Sequelize
Sequelize is a module that enables JS developers to work with relatuina data more easily. 
## Heroku
